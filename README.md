# Rubiks_Cube_UI

Recognizes Rubik's cubes and solves with Kociemba's two-phase algorithm.

***
## **Introduction**

This project implements the following features:
- Rubik's Cube Detection: Utilizes OpenCV to detect and recognize the current state of a Rubik's Cube.
- Solution Steps: Provides a step-by-step solution to solve the cube using Kociemba's two-phase algorithm.
- Cube State Display: Visualizes the current state of the cube during detection and after each solution step.

- **Key Feature:** Recognizes cube from only two opposite corners, no specific order needed. Easy and fast.
